<h2>Practice building semantic HTML</h1>

<h3>Why am I doing this?</h2>
Answer: I have found that as I continue as a Lambda studnet, and prior to, a self taught developer, that I am finding it difficult to maintain pace with the projects associated to the lectures. I have found the reason is, is because I originally thought when we would utilize old code for new projects I could just update the css (Ex: Converting from inline-block to Flexbox), however that is false. I found that I am lacking the skillset to effectively develop and re-create an HTML file to join my CSS properly, so I created this repo to build on such.
